# A ROUGH GUIDE TO ONMYOJI LORE (for those interested)

for starters, your best bet is to read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Onmyoji/comments/m41zha/onmyojis_lore_sort_of/), then to the wiki, which has everything in chronological order, it's still under construction. [click here](https://onmyoji.fandom.com/wiki/Events).

If you prefer something else, the memory scrolls are also a great source of information, just search up "Onmyoji Memory Scrolls" on YouTube. I'll warm you that you need to go hunting for the lore, because it is netease after all, and they.. suck at it.

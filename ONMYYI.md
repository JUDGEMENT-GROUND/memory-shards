# A ROUGH GUIDE TO ONMYOJI LORE (for those interested)

for starters, your best bet is to read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Onmyoji/comments/m41zha/onmyojis_lore_sort_of/), then to the wiki, which has everything in chronological order, it's still under construction. [click here](https://onmyoji.fandom.com/wiki/Events).

If you prefer something else, the memory scrolls are also a great source of information, just search up "Onmyoji Memory Scrolls" on YouTube. I'll warn you that you need to go hunting for the lore, because it is ***NETEASE*** after all, and they.. suck at it.
pay attention because, if i see you mischaracterizing onmyoji shikigamis, you'll see a man running at you 300km/h.

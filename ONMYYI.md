for starters, your best bet is to read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Onmyoji/comments/m41zha/onmyojis_lore_sort_of/), then to the wiki, which has everything in chronological order, it's still under construction. [click here](https://onmyoji.fandom.com/wiki/Events).

If you prefer something else, the memory scrolls are also a great source of information
